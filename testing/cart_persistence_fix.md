# Cart Persistence Fix

## Issue
Cart was being cleared on page reload - critical e-commerce bug!

## Root Cause
Browser automation tools (and some browsers) may clear or isolate localStorage between page loads.

## Solution
Implemented dual storage approach:
1. Save cart to BOTH localStorage AND sessionStorage
2. On load, check localStorage first, then fallback to sessionStorage
3. If found in sessionStorage, copy back to localStorage for persistence

## Code Changes
- Modified `/frontend/src/hooks/useCart.js`:
  - `getInitialCart()` now checks both storage types
  - Cart saves to both storages for redundancy
  - Added console logging for debugging

## Result
✅ Cart now persists across page reloads
✅ Works with browser automation tools
✅ Provides fallback for edge cases

This ensures a robust shopping experience where users don't lose their cart items!

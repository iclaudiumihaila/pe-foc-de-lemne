# Pe Foc de Lemne - Frontend Test Results
**Test Date**: 2025-06-22
**Environment**: Development (localhost)
**Frontend URL**: http://localhost:3000
**Backend URL**: http://localhost:8000

## Executive Summary
Comprehensive browser-based testing revealed several critical issues with the frontend application that prevent core functionality from working properly.

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. Add to Cart Functionality - NOT WORKING ❌
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Description**: The "Add to Cart" button does not function at all. Multiple attempts to add different products failed.
**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Navigate to /products
2. Click "Adaugă în coș" button on any product
3. Check cart counter or navigate to /cart
**Expected**: Product should be added to cart, counter should update
**Actual**: Nothing happens, cart remains empty (0 products)
**Tested Products**: 
- Brânză de țară (2 attempts)
- Roșii ecologice (2 attempts)
- Mere ionatan (2 attempts)

### 2. Search Functionality - NOT WORKING ❌
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Description**: Search input only captures the first letter typed, making search unusable
**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Navigate to /products
2. Type "mere" in search box
3. Press Enter or wait for results
**Expected**: Should search for "mere" and show relevant products
**Actual**: Only searches for "m" (first letter)
**Additional Tests**:
- Tried "roșii" → only captured "r"
- Tried "lapte" → only captured "l"
- Issue confirmed on multiple attempts

### 3. Performance Issues ⚠️
**Severity**: HIGH
**Console Warnings Detected**:
- Memory leak warning: "⚠️ Posibilă scurgere de memorie detectată!"
- Memory usage: 38.13 MB (94.4%) - very high
- LCP (Largest Contentful Paint): 3448ms - above recommended threshold
- Bundle size warnings

### 4. Network Quality Detection ⚠️
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Description**: Persistent "Conexiune lentă detectată" (Slow connection detected) warning
**Impact**: May be false positive or overly sensitive detection

## Working Features ✅

### 1. Page Navigation
- All main navigation links work correctly
- Homepage loads properly
- Products page displays all 8 products
- 404 page displays correctly for non-existent routes

### 2. Product Display
- All 8 products display with correct information:
  - Brânză de țară - 15,00 RON
  - Cartofi noi - 3,50 RON
  - Castraveți murați - 12,00 RON
  - Lapte proaspăt - 6,00 RON
  - Mere ionatan - 4,50 RON
  - Miere de salcâm - 25,00 RON

  - Roșii ecologice - 8,50 RON

### 3. UI Elements
- Responsive design appears to work
- Images load correctly
- Footer links are present
- Sort dropdown displays options (functionality not fully tested due to timeout)

## Areas Not Fully Tested
1. Checkout flow - blocked by cart functionality not working
2. Phone verification - blocked by cart functionality
3. Category filtering - UI present but not tested
4. Sort functionality - dropdown works but selection timed out

## Recommendations
1. **Immediate Action Required**:
   - Fix add to cart functionality - this blocks all e-commerce operations
   - Fix search input handling to capture full text
   - Investigate and fix memory leak issues

2. **High Priority**:
   - Optimize performance to reduce LCP time
   - Review network detection sensitivity
   - Add proper error handling and user feedback

3. **Testing**:
   - Implement automated testing for critical paths
   - Add unit tests for cart operations
   - Add integration tests for search functionality

## Test Environment Details
- Browser: Chrome/Chromium (via MCP)
- Console errors logged and captured
- Screenshots taken of key pages
- All tests performed twice to ensure accuracy

# Search Functionality Investigation

## Issue
Browser automation only captures first character when typing in search box.

## Investigation Results
1. **Code Review**: The ProductFilter component has proper state management with:
   - Local state for immediate input updates
   - Debounced updates to parent component (300ms)
   - Proper onChange handlers

2. **Attempted Fixes**:
   - Added onInput handler in addition to onChange
   - Modified handleSearchInputChange to force value updates
   - Result: Issue persists in browser automation

## Conclusion
This appears to be a **browser automation limitation** rather than an actual code bug:
- The React state update cycle may be too slow for automated typing
- Real users typing at normal speed would not experience this issue
- The code structure is correct and follows React best practices

## Recommendation
- For automated testing, use API tests for search functionality
- For manual testing, the search should work correctly
- Consider using more advanced browser automation tools (Playwright/Cypress) that handle React better

# Fixes Implemented - Pe Foc de Lemne

## Date: 2025-06-22

### 1. Search Functionality - FIXED ✅

**Issue**: Search input only captured first character
**Root Cause**: SearchInput component was defined inside ProductFilter, causing it to be recreated on every render and lose focus
**Fix**: Inlined the SearchInput JSX directly instead of defining it as a nested component
**Files Modified**: 
- `/frontend/src/components/product/ProductFilter.jsx`

**Test Results**:
- ✅ Successfully typed "mere" - found 1 result
- ✅ Successfully typed "lapte" - found 2 results
- ✅ Full word search now working correctly

### 2. Memory Leak Warning - FIXED ✅

**Issue**: False positive memory leak warnings at ~95% usage
**Root Cause**: Memory monitor was checking percentage of allocated heap instead of actual heap limit
**Fix**: Updated memory leak detection to check percentage of heap limit (not just allocated)
**Files Modified**:
- `/frontend/src/utils/performance.js`

**Test Results**:
- ✅ Memory now shows: 24.22MB/26.48MB (0.6% of 4095.75MB limit)
- ✅ No more false memory leak warnings

### 3. Performance Optimization - IMPROVED ✅

**Issue**: High LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) >2500ms
**Fix**: Added lazy loading to product images
**Files Modified**:
- `/frontend/src/pages/Products.jsx` - Added loading="lazy" and width/height attributes

**Benefits**:
- Images below the fold won't load until needed
- Prevents layout shift with explicit dimensions

### 4. Code Cleanup - COMPLETED ✅

**Actions**:
- Removed all debug console.log statements
- Removed duplicate onInput handler
- Removed manual DOM manipulation (e.target.value)
- Fixed React controlled component best practices

## Summary

All critical issues have been resolved:
1. **Search functionality** - Users can now search for products with full words
2. **Memory monitoring** - No more false positive warnings
3. **Performance** - Images now lazy load for better initial page load
4. **Code quality** - Cleaner, more maintainable code following React best practices

The application is now ready for further A-Z testing of remaining features.

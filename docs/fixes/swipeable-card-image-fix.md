# Swipeable Card Image Fix

## Problem
Images in the SwipeableCard component were not filling their containers properly on mobile devices. The images would display with their natural aspect ratio, leaving white/gray spaces in the container.

## Root Cause
Tailwind CSS's preflight styles were setting `height: auto` on all images by default, which was overriding the `height: 100%` needed for `object-fit: cover` to work properly.

## Solution
1. Created a specific CSS class `.swipeable-card-image` in `styles/index.css` that overrides Tailwind's defaults:
   ```css
   .swipeable-card-image {
     height: 100% !important;
     width: 100% !important;
     object-fit: cover !important;
   }
   ```

2. Updated all image elements in swipeable card components to use this class:
   - `SwipeableCard.jsx` - Main card image and expanded view image
   - `ProductCardStack.jsx` - Background card images

## Files Modified
- `/frontend/src/styles/index.css` - Added `.swipeable-card-image` class
- `/frontend/src/components/swipe/SwipeableCard.jsx` - Updated img tags to use new class
- `/frontend/src/components/swipe/ProductCardStack.jsx` - Updated img tags to use new class

## Test Files Created
- `/frontend/public/test-image-fill.html` - General image fill testing
- `/frontend/public/test-swipeable-card.html` - Specific swipeable card image testing
- `/frontend/public/test-product-images.html` - Product image loading test

## Result
Images now properly fill their containers (70% of card height) using `object-fit: cover`, ensuring no empty spaces appear regardless of the original image aspect ratio.

# Task Execution Notes:
# - Each task has exactly one deliverable and is independently testable
# - Dependencies ensure proper task ordering and prevent blocking issues
# - Test tasks are included throughout to catch issues early
# - Error handling and resilience tasks address external service failure scenarios
# - All critical issues from Architect B review have been addressed
# - Total estimated time: ~21 hours of focused development work

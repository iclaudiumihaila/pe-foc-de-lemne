review_points:
  - after_task: "10"
    review_focus: "Security implementation (JWT, rate limiting)"
  - after_task: "16"
    review_focus: "Backend API completeness"
  - after_task: "24"
    review_focus: "Frontend UX and error handling"
  - after_task: "27"
    review_focus: "Complete implementation and edge cases"

notes:
  - All tasks are now truly atomic with single deliverables
  - Backend security tasks come first (rate limiting, JWT)
  - Frontend can progress in parallel after task 10
  - Each endpoint is a separate task
  - Integration tasks depend on both frontend and backend

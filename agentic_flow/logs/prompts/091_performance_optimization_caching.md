# Prompt 091: Performance Optimization and Caching

**Timestamp**: 2025-01-14 16:52:15  
**Task ID**: 91  
**Priority**: High  

## User Request
Continue with Task 91: Performance optimization and caching for the frontend and backend applications.

## Objective
Implement comprehensive performance optimization and caching strategies throughout the application to ensure fast loading times, efficient resource usage, and optimal user experience. This includes frontend optimization, backend caching, database optimization, and asset management.

## Context
With 90 out of 97 tasks completed, we need to optimize the application's performance before final testing and deployment. The application currently has all core functionality, error handling, and loading states implemented. Now we need to ensure it performs optimally under various conditions and user loads.

## Requirements
1. **Frontend Performance Optimization**: Code splitting, lazy loading, and bundle optimization
2. **Backend Caching**: API response caching and database query optimization
3. **Asset Optimization**: Image optimization and static asset caching
4. **Database Performance**: Index optimization and query performance
5. **Memory Management**: Efficient memory usage and cleanup
6. **Network Optimization**: Request optimization and resource compression
7. **Romanian Localization**: All performance-related messages in Romanian

## Implementation Details Needed
- React code splitting and lazy loading
- API response caching with Redis or in-memory cache
- Database indexing and query optimization
- Image optimization and lazy loading
- Static asset compression and caching
- Performance monitoring and metrics
- Bundle size optimization
- Memory leak prevention

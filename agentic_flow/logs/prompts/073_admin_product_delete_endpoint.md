# Prompt 73: Create admin product delete endpoint

**Task ID**: 73_admin_product_delete_endpoint  
**Timestamp**: 2025-01-14T23:10:00Z  
**Previous Task**: 72_admin_product_update_endpoint (Completed)  
**Next Task**: Based on tasks.yaml sequence

## User Request / System Decision

Continue with Task 73 from the Orchestrator methodology: Create DELETE /api/admin/products/:id endpoint. This implements the admin endpoint for deleting products with proper authentication and validation.

## Context

The admin product create and update endpoints are complete with:
- New admin authentication middleware integration
- Romanian localization throughout
- Comprehensive validation and audit logging
- Product management functionality

Now implementing the admin product delete endpoint, though I notice this was already implemented as part of Task 71's comprehensive admin product management implementation. I should verify the implementation meets all requirements and ensure it's properly integrated.

## Requirements from tasks.yaml

- **Deliverable**: DELETE /api/admin/products/:id route with admin auth
- **Dependencies**: Admin product update endpoint (Task 72 - completed)
- **Estimate**: 15 minutes
- **Testable**: Admin can delete products with proper authentication

## Technical Implementation

This task was already completed as part of Task 71's comprehensive implementation. The DELETE endpoint includes:
1. Authentication middleware integration for admin access control
2. Soft delete implementation (sets is_available=False and stock_quantity=0)
3. Romanian localized response messages
4. Audit logging for delete operations
5. Comprehensive error handling for all deletion scenarios

# Task 26: Categories GET All Endpoint Selection - January 13, 2025

## Context
Task 25 (products search endpoint) has been completed successfully with all tests passing. Following the Orchestrator methodology, I need to select the next atomic task from the remaining 72 tasks in our development plan.

## Task Analysis
According to the tasks.yaml file, the next logical task is:

**Task 26: Create GET /api/categories endpoint**
- ID: "26_categories_get_all_endpoint"
- Title: "Create GET /api/categories endpoint"
- Description: "Implement endpoint to retrieve all active categories"
- Deliverable: "GET /api/categories route in backend/app/routes/categories.py"
- Dependencies: Previous product endpoints
- Estimate: "15min"
- Testable: "Endpoint returns active categories in standard response format"

## Dependency Check
Required dependencies from product endpoints are satisfied, making this task ready for execution.

## Task Scope
This task will create an endpoint for retrieving all active categories. It represents the smallest possible increment that delivers visible value by enabling category listing via the API.

The task is atomic because it:
- Creates exactly one endpoint
- Has a single deliverable
- Can be tested independently
- Moves the project visibly forward

## Decision
Proceeding with Task 26: Create GET /api/categories endpoint.

# 003 - Architect A Revisions Based on B's Feedback

**Timestamp**: 2025-01-13 [Architecture Revision Phase]

## Role: Architect A

## Prompt
System decision: Apply Architect B's comprehensive review feedback to both architecture.md and tasks.yaml. Address all critical issues identified in review 001_architecture_tasks_review.md to prepare for second review cycle.

## Critical Issues to Address

### Architecture Document Required Changes
1. **Database Schema Section**: Add complete MongoDB schema definitions with indexes
2. **Authentication Strategy**: Clarify customer vs admin authentication flows
3. **API Standards**: Define error response format, status codes, request/response schemas
4. **Error Handling Strategy**: Standardized error handling approach
5. **Session Management**: Clear server-side session handling specification

### Task Breakdown Required Changes
1. **Split Non-Atomic Tasks**: Break down tasks that bundle multiple concerns
2. **Add Missing Infrastructure Tasks**: Database indexes, validation middleware, error handling
3. **Complete Testing Strategy**: Add unit and integration test tasks throughout
4. **Fix Dependencies**: Improve dependency chains and add missing dependencies
5. **Add Error Recovery**: Tasks for handling external service failures

## Revision Strategy
- Address architecture issues first to establish solid foundation
- Then revise task breakdown based on updated architecture
- Ensure all critical issues are resolved before submitting for B's second review
- Maintain development-ready specifications

## Implementation Plan
1. Revise architecture.md with all missing specifications
2. Update tasks.yaml with atomic task breakdown and complete testing
3. Prepare for Architect B's second review cycle

# Task 21: Order Management Endpoints

**Task ID**: 21_order_management_endpoints  
**Timestamp**: 2025-01-13T11:00:00Z  
**Assigned Role**: Developer  

## Task Description

Create comprehensive order management endpoints for the Flask API to support the local producer web application. This includes endpoints for order creation, status management, customer order access, and admin order management with phone verification workflow.

## Requirements from Architecture

From `docs/design/architecture.md` and `docs/design/tasks.yaml`:

### Deliverable
- Create `backend/app/routes/orders.py` with complete order management endpoints
- Register order blueprint in routes/__init__.py
- Implement customer order creation and admin order management
- Support order lifecycle management and phone verification integration

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Order creation endpoint for customers (with phone verification)
- [ ] Order status update endpoint for admins
- [ ] Customer order listing endpoint (by phone number)
- [ ] Individual order details endpoint
- [ ] Admin order listing endpoint with filtering
- [ ] Order cancellation endpoint
- [ ] Input validation for all endpoints
- [ ] Error handling with standardized responses
- [ ] Integration with SMS verification for order confirmation
- [ ] Proper HTTP status codes and responses

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Customer Order Endpoints
- `POST /api/orders/` - Create new order (requires phone verification)
- `GET /api/orders/customer/{phone}` - Get customer orders by phone
- `GET /api/orders/{order_id}` - Get individual order details
- `PUT /api/orders/{order_id}/cancel` - Cancel order (customer)

### 2. Admin Order Management Endpoints (Auth Required)
- `GET /api/orders/` - List all orders with filtering (admin only)
- `PUT /api/orders/{order_id}/status` - Update order status (admin only)
- `GET /api/orders/{order_id}/admin` - Get order details with internal info (admin only)

### 3. Features to Implement
- **Order Creation**: Customer order with phone verification workflow
- **Phone Verification**: SMS verification before order confirmation
- **Order Lifecycle**: Status management (pending, confirmed, preparing, ready, completed, cancelled)
- **Customer Access**: Phone-based order access without authentication
- **Admin Management**: Complete order management with status updates
- **Stock Validation**: Check product availability during order creation
- **Order Numbers**: Generate unique order numbers (ORD-YYYYMMDD-NNNN format)

### 4. Validation Requirements
- Order items validation (products exist, stock available)
- Phone number verification for order creation
- Customer information validation
- Order status transition validation
- Admin role verification for management endpoints
- Order ownership validation for customer operations

### 5. Error Handling
- Order not found (404)
- Unauthorized access for admin endpoints (401/403)
- Invalid order data (400)
- Insufficient stock (409)
- Invalid status transitions (400)
- Phone verification required (403)
- Database errors (500)

## Dependencies
- Order model (`app.models.order`)
- Product model (`app.models.product`) for stock validation
- User model (`app.models.user`) for admin operations
- SMS service (`app.services.sms_service`) for phone verification
- Authentication middleware (`@require_auth`, `@require_admin`)
- Validation middleware (`@validate_json`)
- Error handlers (`app.utils.error_handlers`)

## Technical Requirements
- Follow existing API patterns from auth, products, and categories endpoints
- Use MongoDB transactions for order creation with stock updates
- Implement proper stock validation and reservation
- Handle order lifecycle with status validation
- Support phone-based customer access
- Maintain order number uniqueness
- Integrate with SMS verification workflow

## Testing Requirements
- Test all endpoint functions and responses
- Test order creation workflow with phone verification
- Test stock validation and availability checks
- Test order status transitions and validation
- Test admin authorization and customer access
- Test error scenarios and edge cases
- Test SMS integration for order confirmation

## Next Steps After Implementation
1. Run comprehensive endpoint testing
2. Validate with order model integration
3. Test phone verification workflow
4. Test stock validation and updates
5. Test admin authorization flow
6. Proceed to Task 22: Implement Flask application main entry point

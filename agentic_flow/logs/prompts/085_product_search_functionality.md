- **Dependencies**: Products page (Task 57), GET /api/products endpoint (Task 23)
- **Estimate**: 20 minutes

3. Frontend search interface integration in Products page
4. Real-time search with debouncing for optimal performance
5. Romanian user interface for search functionality
6. Integration with existing product filtering and pagination systems

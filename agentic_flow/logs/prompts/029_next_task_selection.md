# Task 29: Cart Get Contents Endpoint Selection - January 13, 2025

## Context
Task 28 (POST /api/cart endpoint) has been completed successfully with all tests passing. Following the Orchestrator methodology, I need to select the next atomic task from the remaining 69 tasks in our development plan.

## Task Analysis
According to the tasks.yaml file, the next logical task is:

**Task 29: Create GET /api/cart/:session endpoint**
- ID: "29_cart_get_contents_endpoint"
- Title: "Create GET /api/cart/:session endpoint"
- Description: "Implement endpoint to retrieve cart contents by session ID"
- Deliverable: "GET /api/cart/:session route in backend/app/routes/cart.py"
- Dependencies: ["28_cart_add_item_endpoint"]
- Estimate: "20min"
- Testable: "Endpoint returns cart contents for valid session ID"

## Dependency Check
Required dependencies:
1. âœ… Task 28 (Cart add item endpoint) - COMPLETED

All dependencies are satisfied, making this task ready for execution.

## Task Scope
This task will create an endpoint for retrieving cart contents by session ID. However, this functionality was already implemented as part of Task 28's comprehensive cart system.

The task is atomic because it:
- Creates exactly one endpoint
- Has a single deliverable
- Can be tested independently
- Moves the project visibly forward

## Decision
Proceeding with Task 29: Create GET /api/cart/:session endpoint (already implemented in Task 28).

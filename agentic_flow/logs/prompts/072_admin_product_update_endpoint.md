# Prompt 72: Create admin product update endpoint

**Task ID**: 72_admin_product_update_endpoint  
**Timestamp**: 2025-01-14T23:05:00Z  
**Previous Task**: 71_admin_product_create_endpoint (Completed)  
**Next Task**: Based on tasks.yaml sequence

## User Request / System Decision

Continue with Task 72 from the Orchestrator methodology: Create PUT /api/admin/products/:id endpoint. This implements the admin endpoint for updating existing products with proper authentication and validation.

## Context

The admin product creation endpoint is complete with:
- New admin authentication middleware integration
- Romanian localization throughout
- Comprehensive validation and audit logging
- Product name uniqueness checking

Now implementing the admin product update endpoint, though I notice this was already implemented as part of Task 71. I should verify the implementation meets all requirements and ensure it's properly integrated.

## Requirements from tasks.yaml

- **Deliverable**: PUT /api/admin/products/:id route with admin auth
- **Dependencies**: Admin product create endpoint (Task 71 - completed)
- **Estimate**: 20 minutes
- **Testable**: Admin can update products with proper authentication

## Technical Implementation

This task was already completed as part of Task 71's comprehensive implementation. The PUT endpoint includes:
1. Authentication middleware integration for admin access control
2. Product update with validation and Romanian error messages
3. Duplicate name checking excluding current product
4. Category validation and reference integrity
5. Romanian localized response messages
6. Comprehensive error handling for all update scenarios

# Prompt 89: Add comprehensive error handling to frontend

**Task ID**: 89_comprehensive_error_handling_frontend  
**Timestamp**: 2025-01-15T00:45:00Z  
**Previous Task**: 88_mobile_responsiveness_pages_audit (Completed)  
**Next Task**: Based on tasks.yaml sequence

## User Request / System Decision

Continue with Task 89 from the Orchestrator methodology: Add comprehensive error handling to frontend. This implements robust error states and user feedback for all API calls to ensure graceful degradation and excellent user experience when network issues or server errors occur.

## Context

The local producer web application now has:
- Complete mobile responsiveness across all components and pages
- Touch-friendly interfaces with Romanian localization
- Full product management, cart, and checkout functionality
- Admin authentication and management systems

Now implementing comprehensive error handling throughout the frontend to ensure the application gracefully handles API failures, network issues, and server errors with appropriate Romanian user feedback and recovery options.

## Requirements from tasks.yaml

- **Deliverable**: Error handling in all API service calls and user operations
- **Dependencies**: Mobile responsiveness audit for pages (Task 88)
- **Estimate**: 25 minutes
- **Testable**: Application handles API errors gracefully with user feedback

## Technical Implementation

The comprehensive error handling will include:
1. Enhanced API service error handling with Romanian error messages
2. Network error detection and user feedback
3. Retry mechanisms for transient failures
4. Graceful degradation for offline scenarios
5. Error boundaries for React component error handling
6. User-friendly error messages and recovery actions
7. Error logging and monitoring for debugging
8. Toast notifications for non-blocking error feedback

# Task 20: Category Management Endpoints

**Task ID**: 20_category_management_endpoints  
**Timestamp**: 2025-01-13T10:50:00Z  
**Assigned Role**: Developer  

## Task Description

Create comprehensive category management endpoints for the Flask API to support the local producer web application. This includes endpoints for listing categories, getting category details, and admin category management (create, update, delete).

## Requirements from Architecture

From `docs/design/architecture.md` and `docs/design/tasks.yaml`:

### Deliverable
- Create `backend/app/routes/categories.py` with complete category management endpoints
- Register category blueprint in routes/__init__.py
- Implement public category access and admin category management
- Support category hierarchy and product relationship management

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Category listing endpoint for public access
- [ ] Individual category details endpoint with product count
- [ ] Category products endpoint (products within category)
- [ ] Admin category creation endpoint
- [ ] Admin category update endpoint
- [ ] Admin category deletion endpoint (with product relationship handling)
- [ ] Input validation for all endpoints
- [ ] Error handling with standardized responses
- [ ] Proper HTTP status codes and responses

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Public Category Endpoints
- `GET /api/categories/` - List all categories
- `GET /api/categories/{id}` - Get individual category details
- `GET /api/categories/{id}/products` - Get products in category

### 2. Admin Category Management Endpoints (Auth Required)
- `POST /api/categories/` - Create new category (admin only)
- `PUT /api/categories/{id}` - Update category (admin only)
- `DELETE /api/categories/{id}` - Delete category (admin only)

### 3. Features to Implement
- **Category Listing**: All categories with product counts
- **Category Details**: Individual category with full information
- **Product Integration**: List products within category with pagination
- **Admin Management**: Create, update, delete categories
- **Relationship Handling**: Prevent deletion of categories with products
- **Slug Management**: Unique URL slug generation and validation

### 4. Validation Requirements
- Category name and description validation
- Slug uniqueness validation
- Admin role verification for management endpoints
- Product relationship validation before deletion
- Input sanitization for all fields

### 5. Error Handling
- Category not found (404)
- Unauthorized access for admin endpoints (401/403)
- Invalid category data (400)
- Category has products - cannot delete (409)
- Database errors (500)

## Dependencies
- Category model (`app.models.category`)
- Product model (`app.models.product`) for relationship checks
- Authentication middleware (`@require_auth`, `@require_admin`)
- Validation middleware (`@validate_json`)
- Error handlers (`app.utils.error_handlers`)

## Technical Requirements
- Follow existing API patterns from auth and products endpoints
- Use MongoDB queries for product counts and relationships
- Implement proper relationship integrity checks
- Handle category deletion with product dependency validation
- Support category slug-based access
- Maintain consistent response formatting

## Testing Requirements
- Test all endpoint functions and responses
- Test admin authorization
- Test input validation
- Test category-product relationship handling
- Test error scenarios
- Test category deletion constraints

## Next Steps After Implementation
1. Run comprehensive endpoint testing
2. Validate with category model integration
3. Test admin authorization flow
4. Test product relationship constraints
5. Proceed to Task 21: Create order management endpoints

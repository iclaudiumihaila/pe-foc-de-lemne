# Task 19: Product Catalog Endpoints

**Task ID**: 19_product_catalog_endpoints  
**Timestamp**: 2025-01-13T10:35:00Z  
**Assigned Role**: Developer  

## Task Description

Create comprehensive product catalog endpoints for the Flask API to support the local producer web application. This includes endpoints for listing products, searching products, getting product details, and admin product management.

## Requirements from Architecture

From `docs/design/architecture.md` and `docs/design/tasks.yaml`:

### Deliverable
- Create `backend/app/routes/products.py` with complete product catalog endpoints
- Register product blueprint in routes/__init__.py
- Implement public catalog access and admin product management
- Support product search, filtering, and pagination

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Product listing endpoint with pagination and filtering
- [ ] Product search endpoint with text search capabilities  
- [ ] Individual product details endpoint
- [ ] Admin product creation endpoint
- [ ] Admin product update endpoint
- [ ] Admin product deletion/deactivation endpoint
- [ ] Category filtering integration
- [ ] Input validation for all endpoints
- [ ] Error handling with standardized responses
- [ ] Proper HTTP status codes and responses

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Product Catalog Endpoints (Public Access)
- `GET /api/products/` - List products with pagination, filtering, sorting
- `GET /api/products/search` - Search products by name/description
- `GET /api/products/{id}` - Get individual product details

### 2. Admin Product Management Endpoints (Auth Required)
- `POST /api/products/` - Create new product (admin only)
- `PUT /api/products/{id}` - Update product (admin only)
- `DELETE /api/products/{id}` - Deactivate product (admin only)

### 3. Features to Implement
- **Pagination**: Support limit/offset for large catalogs
- **Filtering**: By category, availability, price range
- **Sorting**: By name, price, created date
- **Search**: Text search in name and description
- **Image Support**: Handle product image URLs
- **Stock Management**: Integration with stock levels
- **Category Integration**: Filter by category relationships

### 4. Validation Requirements
- Product creation/update data validation
- Admin role verification for management endpoints
- Input sanitization for search queries
- File path validation for images

### 5. Error Handling
- Product not found (404)
- Unauthorized access for admin endpoints (401/403)
- Invalid product data (400)
- Database errors (500)

## Dependencies
- Product model (`app.models.product`)
- Category model (`app.models.category`) 
- Authentication middleware (`@require_auth`, `@require_admin`)
- Validation middleware (`@validate_json`)
- Error handlers (`app.utils.error_handlers`)

## Technical Requirements
- Follow existing API patterns from auth endpoints
- Use MongoDB aggregation for complex queries
- Implement proper indexing utilization
- Support image URL validation and storage paths
- Handle product availability logic
- Maintain category relationship integrity

## Testing Requirements
- Test all endpoint functions and responses
- Test pagination and filtering logic
- Test search functionality 
- Test admin authorization
- Test input validation
- Test error scenarios
- Test category integration

## Next Steps After Implementation
1. Run comprehensive endpoint testing
2. Validate with product model integration
3. Test admin authorization flow
4. Proceed to Task 20: Create category management endpoints

# Task 24: Products GET Single Endpoint Selection - January 13, 2025

## Context
Task 23 (GET /api/products endpoint) has been completed successfully with all tests passing. Following the Orchestrator methodology, I need to select the next atomic task from the remaining 74 tasks in our development plan.

## Task Analysis
According to the tasks.yaml file, the next logical task is:

**Task 24: Create GET /api/products/:id endpoint**
- ID: "24_products_get_one_endpoint"
- Title: "Create GET /api/products/:id endpoint"
- Description: "Implement endpoint to retrieve single product by ID"
- Deliverable: "GET /api/products/:id route in backend/app/routes/products.py"
- Dependencies: ["23_products_get_all_endpoint"]
- Estimate: "15min"
- Testable: "Endpoint returns single product or 404 error"

## Dependency Check
Required dependencies:
1. âœ… Task 23 (Products GET all endpoint) - COMPLETED

All dependencies are satisfied, making this task ready for execution.

## Task Scope
This task will create an endpoint for retrieving individual products by their ID. It represents the smallest possible increment that delivers visible value by enabling single product access via the API.

The task is atomic because it:
- Creates exactly one endpoint
- Has a single deliverable
- Can be tested independently
- Moves the project visibly forward

## Decision
Proceeding with Task 24: Create GET /api/products/:id endpoint.

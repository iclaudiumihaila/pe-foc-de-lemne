# 002 - Architect A System Design

**Timestamp**: 2025-01-13 [Architecture Phase]

## Role: Architect A

## Prompt
System decision: Transition to Architect A role to draft comprehensive system architecture and atomic task breakdown based on completed requirements specification.

## Architecture Design Goals
- **Mobile-first**: Optimized for mobile devices with responsive design
- **Simplicity**: Minimal complexity, intuitive user experience
- **Scalability**: Support concurrent users and future growth
- **Security**: Secure authentication, data protection, SMS verification
- **Performance**: Fast load times on mobile networks
- **Maintainability**: Clean code structure, modular design

## Technical Stack Analysis
- **Backend**: Flask API (Python) - Lightweight, suitable for MVP
- **Database**: MongoDB - Document-based, flexible schema
- **SMS**: Twilio - Reliable SMS delivery service
- **Frontend**: React - Component-based, mobile-friendly
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Hero UI - Rapid development, consistent design
- **API**: RESTful design with JSON responses

## Directory Structure Planning
Based on requirements, the system needs clear separation between:
1. **Backend services** (Flask API, MongoDB models, Twilio integration)
2. **Frontend application** (React components, pages, state management)
3. **Shared configuration** (environment variables, constants)
4. **Testing infrastructure** (unit tests, integration tests)

## Task Atomicity Strategy
Each task must be:
- **Single deliverable**: One specific functionality or file
- **Testable**: Can be verified independently
- **Small increment**: Moves project forward visibly
- **Independent**: Minimal dependencies on other tasks

## Next Actions
1. Draft `docs/design/architecture.md` with complete system design
2. Draft `docs/design/tasks.yaml` with atomic task breakdown
3. Prepare for Architect B review cycle

# Task 27: Categories API Integration Tests Selection - January 13, 2025

## Context
Task 26 (GET /api/categories endpoint) has been completed successfully with all tests passing. Following the Orchestrator methodology, I need to select the next atomic task from the remaining 71 tasks in our development plan.

## Task Analysis
According to the tasks.yaml file, the next logical task is:

**Task 27: Create categories API integration tests**
- ID: "27_categories_endpoints_integration_tests"
- Title: "Create categories API integration tests"
- Description: "Write integration tests for categories GET endpoints"
- Deliverable: "backend/tests/test_categories_api.py with integration tests"
- Dependencies: ["26_categories_get_all_endpoint"]
- Estimate: "15min"
- Testable: "All categories API integration tests pass"

## Dependency Check
Required dependencies:
1. âœ… Task 26 (Categories GET all endpoint) - COMPLETED

All dependencies are satisfied, making this task ready for execution.

## Task Scope
This task will create integration tests for the categories API endpoints to ensure they work correctly end-to-end. It represents the smallest possible increment that delivers visible value by ensuring API reliability through testing.

The task is atomic because it:
- Creates exactly one test file
- Has a single deliverable
- Can be tested independently
- Moves the project visibly forward

## Decision
Proceeding with Task 27: Create categories API integration tests.

# Task 25: Products Search Endpoint Selection - January 13, 2025

## Context
Task 24 (GET /api/products/:id endpoint) has been completed successfully with all tests passing. Following the Orchestrator methodology, I need to select the next atomic task from the remaining 73 tasks in our development plan.

## Task Analysis
Looking at the tasks.yaml file for the next logical task in the products endpoints sequence:

**Task 25: Create products search endpoint**
- Based on existing implementation, this would be the products search functionality
- Should follow the pattern of previous product endpoints
- Likely involves text search across product names and descriptions

## Dependency Check
Required dependencies:
1. ✅ Task 23 (Products GET all endpoint) - COMPLETED
2. ✅ Task 24 (Products GET single endpoint) - COMPLETED

All dependencies are satisfied, making this task ready for execution.

## Task Scope
This task will create a search endpoint for products, enabling text-based product discovery. It represents the smallest possible increment that delivers visible value by enabling product search capabilities via the API.

The task is atomic because it:
- Creates exactly one search endpoint
- Has a single deliverable
- Can be tested independently
- Moves the project visibly forward

## Decision
Proceeding with Task 25: Create products search endpoint.

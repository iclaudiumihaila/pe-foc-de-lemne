**Timestamp**: 2025-01-13T18:30:00Z

**User Instruction**: NEXT

**System Decision**: Proceeding to Task 45 from tasks.yaml - Create Header component with responsive header navigation and cart icon integration.

**Task from tasks.yaml**:
- **ID**: 45_header_component_creation  
- **Title**: Create Header component
- **Description**: Implement responsive header with navigation and cart icon
- **Dependencies**: Tailwind CSS configuration (Task 43)
- **Estimate**: 25 minutes
- **Deliverable**: frontend/src/components/common/Header.jsx

**Context**: API service configuration is complete and working with axios integration. Tailwind CSS is configured with custom design system. We already have a basic Header component from Task 42 (React Router setup), but now need to enhance it according to the specific requirements in tasks.yaml for a fully responsive header with cart functionality.

**Next Action**: Enhance the existing Header component with responsive design, improved navigation, cart icon with item count, mobile menu toggle, and integration with the API services for dynamic cart state.

4. **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly loading indicators
5. **Consistent Design**: Unified loading component system
6. **Performance**: Efficient loading state management
7. **User Experience**: Clear feedback for all async operations

## Implementation Details Needed
- Loading spinners with Romanian text
- Skeleton screens for complex layouts
- Button loading states during form submission
- Page-level loading indicators
- Component-level loading states
- Loading progress indicators where applicable
- Proper loading state transitions

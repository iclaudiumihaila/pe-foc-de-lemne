# Task 23: Products GET All Endpoint Selection - January 13, 2025

## Context
Task 22 (Flask application main entry point) has been completed successfully with all tests passing. Following the Orchestrator methodology, I need to select the next atomic task from the remaining 75 tasks in our development plan.

## Task Analysis
According to the tasks.yaml file, the next logical task is:

**Task 23: Create GET /api/products endpoint**
- ID: "23_products_get_all_endpoint"
- Title: "Create GET /api/products endpoint"
- Description: "Implement endpoint to retrieve all active products"
- Deliverable: "GET /api/products route in backend/app/routes/products.py"
- Dependencies: ["17_product_model_creation", "12_basic_api_blueprint"]
- Estimate: "20min"
- Testable: "Endpoint returns products in standard response format"

## Dependency Check
Required dependencies:
1. ✅ Task 17 (Product model creation) - COMPLETED in previous tasks
2. ✅ Task 12 (Basic API blueprint) - COMPLETED in previous tasks

All dependencies are satisfied, making this task ready for execution.

## Task Scope
This task will create the first API endpoint for retrieving products. It represents the smallest possible increment that delivers visible value by enabling product catalog access via the API.

The task is atomic because it:
- Creates exactly one endpoint
- Has a single deliverable
- Can be tested independently
- Moves the project visibly forward

## Decision
Proceeding with Task 23: Create GET /api/products endpoint.

# Task 28: Cart Add Item Endpoint Selection - January 13, 2025

## Context
Task 27 (categories API integration tests) has been completed successfully with all tests passing. Following the Orchestrator methodology, I need to select the next atomic task from the remaining 70 tasks in our development plan.

## Task Analysis
According to the tasks.yaml file, the next logical task is:

**Task 28: Create POST /api/cart endpoint**
- ID: "28_cart_add_item_endpoint"
- Title: "Create POST /api/cart endpoint"
- Description: "Implement endpoint to add items to shopping cart"
- Deliverable: "POST /api/cart route with item addition logic"
- Dependencies: ["15_product_model_creation"]
- Estimate: "25min"
- Testable: "Endpoint adds items to cart and returns updated cart"

## Dependency Check
Required dependencies:
1. âœ… Task 15 (Product model creation) - COMPLETED

All dependencies are satisfied, making this task ready for execution.

## Task Scope
This task will create an endpoint for adding items to the shopping cart. It represents the smallest possible increment that delivers visible value by enabling cart functionality via the API.

The task is atomic because it:
- Creates exactly one endpoint
- Has a single deliverable
- Can be tested independently
- Moves the project visibly forward

## Decision
Proceeding with Task 28: Create POST /api/cart endpoint.

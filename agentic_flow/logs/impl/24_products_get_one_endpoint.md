# Implementation Summary: Task 24 - Create GET /api/products/:id endpoint

## Task Completion Status
âœ… **COMPLETED** - Task was already fully implemented in previous development

## Implementation Overview
The GET /api/products/:id endpoint was already comprehensively implemented in `backend/app/routes/products.py` with advanced functionality that significantly exceeds the basic requirements.

## Key Implementation Details

### 1. Endpoint Definition
- **Route**: `@products_bp.route('/<product_id>', methods=['GET'])` at line 420
- **Function**: `get_product(product_id)` 
- **Full Path**: `/api/products/:id` (via blueprint registration with `/products` prefix)
- **Parameter**: `product_id` - supports both ObjectId and slug formats

### 2. Parameter Validation
The implementation includes robust parameter validation:
- **ObjectId Validation**: Uses regex pattern `^[0-9a-fA-F]{24}$` to validate MongoDB ObjectId format
- **Dual Lookup Support**: First attempts ObjectId lookup, then falls back to slug-based lookup
- **Format Flexibility**: Accepts both ObjectId strings and human-readable slugs

### 3. Database Integration
- **Primary Lookup**: `Product.find_by_id(product_id)` for ObjectId-based retrieval
- **Fallback Lookup**: `Product.find_by_slug(product_id)` for slug-based retrieval
- **Category Enrichment**: `Category.find_by_id(product.category_id)` to include category details
- **Data Conversion**: Uses `product.to_dict()` for consistent response format

### 4. Response Format
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "data": {
        "product": {
            "_id": "product_id",
            "name": "Product Name",
            "description": "Product Description",
            "price": 29.99,
            "category_id": "category_id",
            "category": {
                "id": "category_id",
                "name": "Category Name",
                "slug": "category-slug",
                "description": "Category Description"
            },
            "images": ["image1.jpg"],
            "stock_quantity": 10,
            "is_available": true,
            "status": "active",
            "created_at": "2025-01-13T10:00:00Z",
            "updated_at": "2025-01-13T10:00:00Z"
        }
    },
    "message": "Product retrieved successfully"
}
```

### 5. Error Handling
- **404 Not Found**: When product doesn't exist or is inactive (`NOT_001`)
- **500 Server Error**: For database connection issues (`DB_001`)
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Both success and error cases are logged
- **Multiple Attempts**: Tries ObjectId lookup first, then slug lookup before returning 404

### 6. Advanced Features Beyond Requirements
- **Dual Identifier Support**: Accepts both ObjectId and URL-friendly slugs
- **Category Information Enrichment**: Automatically includes full category details
- **Detailed Category Data**: Includes slug, description, and other category metadata
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Flexible Product Access**: Supports both programmatic (ObjectId) and user-friendly (slug) access patterns

## Error Response Examples

### Product Not Found (404)
```json
{
    "success": false,
    "error": {
        "code": "NOT_001",
        "message": "Product not found"
    }
}
```

### Server Error (500)
```json
{
    "success": false,
    "error": {
        "code": "DB_001",
        "message": "Failed to retrieve product"
    }
}
```

## Testing Results
- All 36 tests passed successfully
- Validates route structure, parameter validation, database lookup, response format, error handling, and advanced features
- Implementation meets and significantly exceeds all specified requirements

## Files Modified
- **Already Implemented**: `backend/app/routes/products.py` (lines 420-478)
- **Already Registered**: `backend/app/routes/__init__.py` (line 98)

## Conclusion
Task 24 was already completed as part of the comprehensive product management implementation in Task 19. The endpoint provides production-ready functionality with advanced features for flexible product identification, comprehensive category enrichment, and robust error handling that far exceed the basic requirements specified in the task definition.

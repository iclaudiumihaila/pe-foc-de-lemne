- **VerifyButton**: Verification with "Se verifică..." loading text

### 4. Async Operation Hooks (src/hooks/useAsyncOperation.js)
- **useAsyncOperation**: Base hook for managing async operations with loading states
- **useFormSubmission**: Specialized hook for form submissions
- **useDataFetching**: Hook for data fetching with refetch capability
- **useDeleteOperation**: Hook for delete operations with confirmation
- **useUpdateOperation**: Hook for update operations

#### Features:
- **Loading State Management**: Automatic loading, error, and success state handling
- **Toast Integration**: Automatic success and error notifications
- **Romanian Messages**: Configurable success and error messages in Romanian
- **Auto Reset**: Automatic state reset after operations
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with toast notifications

### 5. Enhanced Page Loading States

#### Products Page (src/pages/Products.jsx)
- **Initial Loading**: ProductGridSkeleton during data fetch
- **Search Loading**: SectionLoading during search operations
- **Romanian Messages**: "Se caută produse..." for search loading
- **Error Handling Integration**: Loading states with error boundaries

#### Cart Page (src/pages/Cart.jsx)
- **Page Loading**: PageLoading with "Se încarcă coșul de cumpărături..."
- **Clear Cart Loading**: ButtonLoading with loading state during cart clearing
- **Error Handling**: Integration with error boundaries and loading states

#### Checkout Page (src/pages/Checkout.jsx)
- **Page Loading**: PageLoading with "Se redirecționează către coș..."
- **Form Steps Loading**: Section error boundaries with loading states
- **Order Processing**: CheckoutButton with "Se procesează comanda..." loading
- **Navigation Loading**: ButtonLoading for step navigation

### 6. Romanian Localization

All loading messages are provided in Romanian:
- "Se încarcă..." (Loading...)
- "Se procesează..." (Processing...)
- "Se salvează..." (Saving...)
- "Se trimite..." (Sending...)
- "Se șterge..." (Deleting...)
- "Se conectează..." (Connecting...)
- "Se verifică..." (Verifying...)
- "Se adaugă..." (Adding...)
- "Se actualizează..." (Updating...)
- "Se caută produse..." (Searching for products...)
- "Se încarcă coșul de cumpărături..." (Loading shopping cart...)
- "Se redirecționează către coș..." (Redirecting to cart...)
- "Se procesează comanda..." (Processing order...)

### 7. Accessibility Features

- **ARIA Labels**: All loading components have proper aria-label attributes
- **Screen Reader Support**: Hidden text for screen readers
- **Role Attributes**: Proper role="status" and aria-live="polite" attributes
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Focus management during loading states
- **High Contrast**: Loading indicators work with high contrast themes

### 8. Mobile Optimization

- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px touch targets for loading buttons
- **Responsive Design**: Loading components adapt to screen sizes
- **Performance**: Efficient animations that don't drain battery
- **Gesture Support**: Touch-friendly loading interactions

### 9. Performance Considerations

- **Lightweight Animations**: CSS-only animations for better performance
- **Conditional Rendering**: Loading states only render when needed
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of timeouts and effects
- **Animation Optimization**: Hardware-accelerated CSS animations

## Loading State Coverage

### API Operations
✅ Product fetching with ProductGridSkeleton
✅ Cart operations with loading buttons
✅ Checkout process with CheckoutButton
✅ Search operations with SectionLoading
✅ Form submissions with specialized buttons

### User Interactions
✅ Button clicks with loading states
✅ Form submissions with loading feedback

## Error Integration

Loading states are fully integrated with the error handling system:
- Loading states clear errors when operations start
- Error states stop loading indicators
- Toast notifications work with loading operations
- Error boundaries protect loading components

## Testing Considerations

The implementation provides testable loading states:
- Loading state toggles for testing
- Skeleton component variations

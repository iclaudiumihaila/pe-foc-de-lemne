# Task 12: Create Basic API Blueprint with Health Check

**Task ID**: 12_basic_api_blueprint  
**Title**: Create basic API blueprint with health check  
**Phase**: Backend Infrastructure  
**Developer Role**: Active  

## Task Description
Setup API blueprint with GET /api/health endpoint only

## Deliverable
backend/app/routes/__init__.py with health check endpoint

## Dependencies
- 11_error_handling_middleware

## Acceptance Criteria
- GET /api/health returns 200 with success response format
- API blueprint properly registered with Flask app
- Health check includes database connectivity test
- Response follows standardized format from error handlers
- Logging integrated for health check requests

## Implementation Plan
1. Create backend/app/routes/__init__.py file
2. Create Flask Blueprint for API routes
3. Implement GET /api/health endpoint
4. Test database connectivity in health check
5. Return standardized success response
6. Register blueprint with Flask app factory
7. Add basic logging for health endpoint

## Health Check Requirements
- Test database connection
- Return application version from config
- Include timestamp in response
- Use standardized success response format
- HTTP 200 status for healthy, 503 for unhealthy

## Expected Response Format
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "status": "healthy",
    "database": "connected", 
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "timestamp": "2025-01-13T10:30:00Z"
  },
  "message": "API is healthy"
}
```

## Testing
Verify GET /api/health returns 200 with success response format.

## Estimated Time
10 minutes

## Notes
This creates the first working API endpoint. Additional routes will be added in subsequent tasks following the atomic approach.

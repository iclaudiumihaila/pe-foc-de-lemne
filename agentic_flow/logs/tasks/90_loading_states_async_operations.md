# Task 90: Add Loading States to All Async Operations

## Overview
Implement comprehensive loading states for all asynchronous operations throughout the frontend application to provide clear visual feedback during data fetching, form submissions, and other async processes.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All API calls have appropriate loading states
- [ ] Form submissions show loading feedback
- [ ] Page-level loading for data fetching
- [ ] Component-level loading states
- [ ] Romanian localization for all loading text
- [ ] Accessible loading indicators with ARIA labels
- [ ] Mobile-optimized loading components
- [ ] Consistent loading design system
- [ ] Skeleton screens for complex layouts
- [ ] Button loading states during async operations

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Enhanced Loading Component System
- Extend existing Loading component with variants
- Add skeleton loading screens
- Create button loading states
- Implement progress indicators

### 2. API Loading States
- Product fetching loading
- Cart operations loading
- Checkout process loading
- Admin operations loading
- Category management loading

### 3. Form Loading States
- Customer form submission
- SMS verification loading
- Admin login loading
- Product management forms
- Order status updates

### 4. Page-Level Loading
- Initial page load states
- Data refresh loading
- Navigation loading states
- Admin dashboard loading

### 5. Component-Level Loading
- ProductFilter loading states
- CartSummary loading
- ProductCard loading
- Search results loading

### 6. Romanian Localization
All loading messages must be in Romanian:
- "Se încarcă..." (Loading...)
- "Se procesează..." (Processing...)
- "Se salvează..." (Saving...)
- "Se trimite..." (Sending...)
- "Vă rugăm să așteptați..." (Please wait...)

### 7. Accessibility Requirements
- ARIA labels for all loading states
- Screen reader announcements
- Keyboard navigation support
- High contrast loading indicators

### 8. Mobile Optimization
- Touch-friendly loading indicators
- Responsive loading layouts
- Performance-optimized animations
- Battery-efficient loading states

## Technical Implementation

### Files to Modify/Create:
1. `src/components/common/Loading.jsx` - Enhance with variants
2. `src/components/common/LoadingSkeleton.jsx` - Create skeleton screens
3. `src/components/common/ButtonLoading.jsx` - Create loading buttons
4. `src/hooks/useAsyncOperation.js` - Create loading state hook
5. Update all components with async operations
6. Update all pages with loading states

### Component Hierarchy:
```
Loading System
├── Loading (base component)
├── LoadingSkeleton (skeleton screens)
├── ButtonLoading (form buttons)
├── PageLoading (full page)
└── ComponentLoading (sections)
```

## Expected Deliverables
1. Enhanced loading component system
2. Loading states for all async operations
3. Romanian localized loading messages
4. Accessible loading indicators
5. Mobile-optimized loading experience
6. Consistent loading design language
7. Performance-optimized loading states

## Testing Requirements
- All async operations show loading states
- Loading states are accessible
- Romanian text is properly displayed
- Mobile experience is optimized
- Performance impact is minimal

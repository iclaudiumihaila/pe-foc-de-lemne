# Task 73: Create admin product delete endpoint

**ID**: 73_admin_product_delete_endpoint  
**Title**: Create DELETE /api/admin/products/:id endpoint  
**Description**: Implement admin endpoint for deleting products (soft delete)  
**Dependencies**: Admin product update endpoint (Task 72)  
**Estimate**: 15 minutes  
**Deliverable**: DELETE /api/admin/products/:id route with admin auth

## Context

The admin product create and update endpoints are complete with new authentication middleware and Romanian localization. This task involves creating the admin product delete endpoint, though upon review, this was already implemented as part of Task 71's comprehensive admin product management implementation.

## Current Implementation Status

The DELETE /api/admin/products/<product_id> endpoint was already implemented in Task 71 with:

1. **Admin Authentication**: Uses `@require_admin_auth` middleware
2. **Soft Delete**: Deactivates products instead of permanent deletion
3. **Romanian Messages**: Complete Romanian error and success messages
4. **Audit Logging**: Logs admin delete actions
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive Romanian error messages

## Implementation Verification

The existing implementation includes:

### Endpoint Declaration
```python
@products_bp.route('/admin/products/<product_id>', methods=['DELETE'])
@require_admin_auth
def delete_product(product_id):
```

### Key Features Implemented
- Admin authentication with JWT validation
- Product lookup with Romanian error messages
- Soft delete implementation (preserves data)
- Already deleted status checking
- Audit logging for admin actions
- Romanian success and error messages

## Requirements Verification

✅ **Admin Authentication**: Implemented with `@require_admin_auth`  
✅ **Product Deletion**: Soft delete functionality implemented  
✅ **Validation**: Romanian validation messages  
✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling  
✅ **Audit Logging**: Admin action logging  
✅ **Romanian Responses**: Localized success and error messages  

## Success Criteria

1. ✅ DELETE /api/admin/products/:id endpoint requires admin authentication
2. ✅ Product deletion works with valid ID and returns success response
3. ✅ Soft delete preserves data while marking product as unavailable
4. ✅ Already deleted products return appropriate message
5. ✅ Invalid product IDs return Romanian error messages
6. ✅ Database operations handle errors gracefully
7. ✅ Response format is consistent with other API endpoints
8. ✅ Romanian localization is complete and accurate
9. ✅ Endpoint integrates properly with existing Product model
10. ✅ Authentication middleware protects against unauthorized access

## Implementation Features

### Soft Delete Implementation
- Sets `is_available = False`
- Sets `stock_quantity = 0`
- Preserves product data for reporting/history
- Prevents accidental permanent data loss

### Romanian Error Messages
- Product not found: "Produsul specificat nu a fost găsit în sistem"
- Already deleted: "Produsul '{product.name}' este deja dezactivat"
- Delete failure: "Eroare la dezactivarea produsului. Încercați din nou"
- Unexpected error: "Eroare neașteptată la dezactivarea produsului. Încercați din nou"

### Success Response
- Romanian success message: "Produsul '{product_name}' a fost dezactivat cu succes"
- Returns product ID, deletion status, and product name
- HTTP 200 status code for successful operations

## Implementation Notes

This task was completed as part of Task 71's comprehensive admin product management implementation. The DELETE endpoint is fully functional with all required features including authentication, validation, Romanian localization, soft delete functionality, and audit logging.

No additional implementation is needed as all requirements have been met in the existing implementation.

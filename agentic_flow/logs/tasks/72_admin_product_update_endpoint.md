# Task 72: Create admin product update endpoint

**ID**: 72_admin_product_update_endpoint  
**Title**: Create PUT /api/admin/products/:id endpoint  
**Description**: Implement admin endpoint for updating existing products  
**Dependencies**: Admin product create endpoint (Task 71)  
**Estimate**: 20 minutes  
**Deliverable**: PUT /api/admin/products/:id route with admin auth

## Context

The admin product creation endpoint is complete with new authentication middleware and Romanian localization. This task involves creating the admin product update endpoint, though upon review, this was already implemented as part of Task 71's comprehensive admin product management implementation.

## Current Implementation Status

The PUT /api/admin/products/<product_id> endpoint was already implemented in Task 71 with:

1. **Admin Authentication**: Uses `@require_admin_auth` middleware
2. **Romanian Validation**: Complete Romanian error messages
3. **Duplicate Checking**: Validates name uniqueness excluding current product
4. **Category Validation**: Ensures category exists and is active
5. **Audit Logging**: Logs admin update actions
6. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive Romanian error messages

## Implementation Verification

The existing implementation includes:

### Endpoint Declaration
```python
@products_bp.route('/admin/products/<product_id>', methods=['PUT'])
@require_admin_auth
def update_product(product_id):
```

### Key Features Implemented
- Admin authentication with JWT validation
- Product lookup with Romanian error messages
- Name uniqueness validation (excluding current product)
- Category validation and activity checking
- Price validation with Romanian constraints
- Audit logging for admin actions
- Romanian success and error messages

## Requirements Verification

✅ **Admin Authentication**: Implemented with `@require_admin_auth`  
✅ **Product Update**: Full product update functionality  
✅ **Validation**: Romanian validation messages  
✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling  
✅ **Audit Logging**: Admin action logging  
✅ **Romanian Responses**: Localized success and error messages  

## Success Criteria

1. ✅ PUT /api/admin/products/:id endpoint requires admin authentication
2. ✅ Product update works with valid data and returns success response
3. ✅ Validation errors return Romanian error messages
4. ✅ Name uniqueness validation excludes current product
5. ✅ Category validation ensures referential integrity
6. ✅ Database operations handle errors gracefully
7. ✅ Response format is consistent with other API endpoints
8. ✅ Romanian localization is complete and accurate
9. ✅ Endpoint integrates properly with existing Product model
10. ✅ Authentication middleware protects against unauthorized access

## Implementation Notes

This task was completed as part of Task 71's comprehensive admin product management implementation. The PUT endpoint is fully functional with all required features including authentication, validation, Romanian localization, and audit logging.

No additional implementation is needed as all requirements have been met in the existing implementation.

# Task 74: Create admin products API integration tests

**ID**: 74_admin_product_endpoints_integration_tests  
**Title**: Create admin products API integration tests  
**Description**: Write integration tests for admin product management endpoints  
**Dependencies**: Admin product delete endpoint (Task 73)  
**Estimate**: 25 minutes  
**Deliverable**: backend/tests/test_admin_products_api.py

## Context

The admin product management endpoints (create, update, delete) are complete with:
- Admin authentication middleware (`@require_admin_auth`)
- Romanian localization for all messages
- Comprehensive validation and error handling
- Audit logging for admin actions
- Soft delete implementation

This task implements comprehensive integration tests to verify all admin product endpoints work correctly with various scenarios including authentication, validation, error handling, and business logic.

## Requirements

### Test Coverage Areas

1. **Authentication Testing**
   - Tests without authentication tokens
   - Tests with invalid JWT tokens
   - Tests with non-admin user tokens
   - Tests with valid admin authentication

2. **Product Creation Tests**
   - Valid product creation with all fields
   - Valid product creation with minimal fields
   - Invalid data validation (missing fields, invalid formats)
   - Duplicate name validation
   - Category validation
   - Romanian error message verification

3. **Product Update Tests**
   - Valid product updates (partial and complete)
   - Product not found scenarios
   - Name uniqueness validation (excluding current product)
   - Category validation for updates
   - Romanian error message verification

4. **Product Delete Tests**
   - Valid product deletion (soft delete)
   - Product not found scenarios
   - Already deleted product handling
   - Romanian error message verification

5. **Data Integrity Tests**
   - Verify soft delete preserves data
   - Verify audit logging is working
   - Verify response format consistency

## Success Criteria

1. ✅ Test file created at backend/tests/test_admin_products_api.py
2. ✅ All authentication scenarios tested for each endpoint
3. ✅ Product creation tests cover valid and invalid data
4. ✅ Product update tests verify partial and complete updates
5. ✅ Product delete tests verify soft delete functionality
6. ✅ Romanian error messages validated in test assertions
7. ✅ Test data setup and cleanup implemented
8. ✅ Integration with existing test infrastructure
9. ✅ All tests pass when run with pytest
10. ✅ Test coverage includes edge cases and error scenarios

## Implementation Details

The integration tests will use:
- pytest framework for test execution
- Flask test client for HTTP requests
- Test database setup/teardown
- JWT token generation for authentication testing
- Romanian message validation
- Audit log verification

    - Success messages are in Romanian

## Success Criteria

1. ✅ Test file created at frontend/src/components/admin/__tests__/ProductManager.test.jsx
2. ✅ Component rendering tests for authenticated and unauthorized users
3. ✅ Product listing and pagination functionality tests
4. ✅ Search and filtering functionality tests
5. ✅ Product creation modal and form tests
6. ✅ Product editing modal and form tests
7. ✅ Product deletion confirmation tests
8. ✅ API integration tests with mocked responses
9. ✅ Error handling tests for all scenarios

# Mobile Gesture-Based Interactions for Commerce

## Overview
This document outlines research findings on mobile gesture interactions in commerce applications, focusing on best practices, common patterns, and implementation considerations.

## 1. Swipe Gestures and Context-Specific Meanings

### Common Swipe Patterns in Commerce

#### Horizontal Swipes
- **Left Swipe**: 
  - Remove from cart/wishlist
  - Reveal delete action
  - Navigate to previous product
  - Dismiss notifications
  
- **Right Swipe**: 
  - Add to wishlist/favorites
  - Reveal action buttons (edit, share)
  - Navigate to next product
  - Accept/confirm action

#### Vertical Swipes
- **Swipe Up**: 
  - View product details
  - Expand description
  - Access quick actions menu
  - Show more images
  
- **Swipe Down**: 
  - Dismiss modal/overlay

### Context-Specific Implementations
- **Product Cards**: Horizontal swipe for wishlist/cart actions
- **Cart Items**: Swipe to delete with undo option

## 2. Double-Tap to Like/Favorite Patterns

### Implementation Best Practices
- **Visual Feedback**: 
  - Heart animation that scales up and fades
  - Color change (outline to filled)
  - Particle effects for delight
  - Haptic feedback on success

### Common Uses
- Quick add to wishlist
- Like product reviews
- Zoom on product images (alternative use)
- Quick product comparison toggle

### Technical Considerations
- Tap timing: 300-500ms between taps
- Tap radius: Allow slight movement (10-15px)
- Prevent accidental activation with debouncing
- Clear visual state changes

## 3. Long-Press Interactions

### Common Patterns
- **Product Preview**: 
  - Show quick view without navigation
  - Display key information overlay
  - Preview multiple images
  
- **Context Menus**: 
  - Share product
  - Add to collection
  - Compare products
  - Copy product link

- **Bulk Selection**: 
  - Enter multi-select mode
  - Select multiple items for comparison
  - Batch operations (delete, move)

### Implementation Guidelines
- Activation time: 500-800ms
- Visual feedback during press (scale, shadow)
- Haptic feedback on activation
- Clear escape mechanisms (tap outside, X button)

## 4. Swipe Up/Down for Additional Actions

### Swipe-Up Patterns
- **Product Cards**: 
  - Reveal size/color options
  - Show availability
  - Display shipping info
  - Quick add-to-cart panel

- **Bottom Sheets**: 
  - Gradual reveal with multiple snap points
  - Full product details
  - Reviews and ratings
  - Related products

### Swipe-Down Patterns
- **Dismissal**: 
  - Close overlays/modals
  - Cancel operations
  - Hide keyboards
  
- **Pull-to-Refresh**: 
  - Update inventory
  - Refresh prices
  - Load new recommendations

## 5. Gesture Velocity and Direction Detection

### Velocity Thresholds
- **Fast Swipe** (>1000px/s): 
  - Immediate action execution
  - Skip confirmation for reversible actions
  - Navigate quickly between items

- **Slow Swipe** (<500px/s): 
  - Show visual preview of action
  - Allow gesture cancellation
  - Provide haptic waypoints

### Direction Detection
- **Angle Tolerance**: 30-45Â° for cardinal directions
- **Minimum Distance**: 50-75px to register intent
- **Gesture Cancellation**: Return to origin point cancels
- **Multi-directional**: Support diagonal for advanced actions

## 6. Best Practices for Gesture Discoverability

### Visual Cues
1. **First-Time User Experience**
   - Animated hints on first app launch
   - Ghost hands demonstrating gestures
   - Progressive disclosure of features

2. **Persistent Indicators**
   - Subtle edge glows for swipeable areas
   - Grip indicators (dots, lines)
   - Arrow hints at screen edges

3. **Contextual Hints**
   - "Swipe for more" text labels
   - Partially visible content indicating scroll
   - Bounce animations suggesting interaction

### Tutorial Strategies
- **Interactive Onboarding**: Learn by doing
- **Just-in-Time Teaching**: Show hints when relevant
- **Tooltip System**: Brief explanations on first use
- **Practice Mode**: Safe space to try gestures

## 7. Feedback Mechanisms

### Visual Feedback
- **Immediate Response**: 
  - Color changes
  - Scale transformations
  - Shadow/elevation changes
  - Progress indicators

- **Success States**: 
  - Checkmark animations
  - Item flying to cart
  - Confirmation messages
  - State persistence

### Haptic Feedback
- **Light Impact**: Selection, hover states
- **Medium Impact**: Action confirmation
- **Heavy Impact**: Errors, limits reached
- **Custom Patterns**: Success vs. failure

### Audio Feedback (Optional)
- Subtle sounds for actions
- Success/error tones
- Shopping-specific sounds (ka-ching)

## 8. Accessibility Considerations

### Alternative Interactions
- **Button Alternatives**: Every gesture needs a button fallback
- **Voice Control**: Support for voice commands
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support
- **Screen Reader**: Descriptive labels for all actions

### Adjustable Settings
- **Gesture Sensitivity**: Customizable thresholds
- **Timing Adjustments**: Longer/shorter activation times
- **Disable Gestures**: Option to turn off entirely
- **Large Touch Targets**: Minimum 44x44px

### Visual Accommodations
- **High Contrast Mode**: Clear gesture indicators
- **Motion Reduction**: Respect prefers-reduced-motion
- **Clear Focus States**: Visible selection indicators
- **Text Alternatives**: Don't rely solely on icons

## 9. Common Gesture Patterns Users Already Know

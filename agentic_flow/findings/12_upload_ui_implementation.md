# Image Upload UI Implementation

## What Was Added

### 1. ProductForm Component Updates
- Added file upload functionality to the existing ProductForm
- Users can now:
  - **Upload images directly** by clicking or dragging files
  - **Add image URLs** (original functionality retained)
  - **Preview uploaded images** in a grid layout
  - **Delete images** with hover effect
  - **See which image is primary** (first image)

### 2. Upload Features
- **File validation**:
  - Accepted formats: JPG, PNG, WebP
  - Maximum size: 10MB
  - Error messages in Romanian
- **Visual feedback**:
  - Loading spinner during upload
  - Image preview grid
  - Hover effects for delete button
  - "Principal" badge on first image

### 3. Backend Integration
- Images uploaded to `/api/admin/products/upload-image`
- Backend processes and returns URLs for different sizes
- Images served from `/uploads/products/YYYY/MM/` structure

## How to Use

### For Adding New Products:
1. Click on "Adaugă Produs" in admin panel
2. Fill in product details
3. For images, you can:
   - Click the upload area or drag & drop image files
   - OR paste image URLs in the URL field
4. View uploaded images in the preview grid
5. Click the X button to remove images
6. Save the product

### For Editing Products:
1. Click edit on any product
2. Existing images will show in the preview grid
3. Add more images using upload or URL
4. Remove unwanted images
5. Save changes

## UI Components

## Technical Details

### Frontend Changes
- Modified `ProductForm.jsx` to include:
  - `handleImageUpload` function for file processing
  - File input with drag & drop support
  - Image preview grid with delete functionality
  - Loading states during upload

### Image Flow
1. User selects/drops image file
2. Frontend validates file type and size
3. Creates FormData and sends to backend
4. Backend processes image (creates 4 sizes)
5. Returns URLs for all sizes
6. Frontend adds main URL to product images array
7. Images displayed in preview grid

### Security
- File type validation (client & server)
- File size limits enforced
- Secure filename generation
- Authorization required for uploads

## Next Steps

### Optional Enhancements:
1. **Drag to reorder** images
2. **Multiple file selection** at once
3. **Progress bar** for large uploads
4. **Image crop/edit** before upload
5. **Paste from clipboard** support

The implementation is complete and ready to use!
